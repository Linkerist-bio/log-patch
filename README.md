# log-patch

	A part of my patches for some open source project.

	Patches and description in this repository is just a log for my activities in some open source projects

	I am busy for this moment and do little contribution for community, and I will not place all my patches here as well.

	You can regard it as a diary for me, although there is few moods for me.

	If you want to know me, deliver your mail to mine,

	and if you have any question for my patches, just patch the patch.
